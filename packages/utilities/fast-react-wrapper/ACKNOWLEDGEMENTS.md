# Acknowledgements

We'd like to extend a massive thank you to [the Lit team](https://github.com/lit/lit) for their work on [the Lit Labs React Wrapper](https://github.com/lit/lit/tree/main/packages/labs/react). This awesome group of people worked out many of the details of how best to wrap a Web Component for a great experience in React. The FAST React Wrapper was able to leverage a substantial bit of that code for its own wrapper. The FAST React Wrapper re-shapes the API and layers on some additional features that enable the wrapper to leverage FAST's metadata, making the wrapping of any FAST Web Component more streamlined. The FAST wrapper also enables a less verbose registration process when integrating with a Design System.

We've provided the Lit Labs React Wrapper license below.
