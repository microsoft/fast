# Subheading
Use various *subheading* sizes to create a clear hierarchy within your page. Subheadings are paired with the Heading component.

## Usage
Use the appropriate numbered tag for the relative importance of each *subheading* compared to other *subheadings* on the page. Subheadings should be descriptive summaries of the content below them. Choose a *subheading* size that best organizes your page content. Then choose the *subheading* tag and size to meet your design needs. For example, an `<h2>` element does not absolutely require a type size of 2, it could be any of the other sizes as well.

## Style guide
Subheadings are a great way to break up your writing. They improve the layout of a page and draw attention to important points.
