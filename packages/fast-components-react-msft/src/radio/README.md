# Radio
An element that can be turned on and off. *Radio* buttons are almost always listed together in groups.

## Usage
Only one *radio* within a *radio* group may be selected at a time. Limit the *radio* label to a single line.

## Style guidance
Do not put two radio groups next to each other. When two radio groups are right next to each other, it’s difficult to determine which radios belong to which group. Use group labels to separate them.
