# Number field

A *number field* is a form component which allows users to input and edit numerical data.

## Usage

The *number field* is not appropriate for input that happens to only consist of numbers but isn’t strictly speaking a number. For example, it would be inappropriate for credit card numbers or US postal codes. A simple way of determining whether to use the *number field* is to consider whether it would make sense for the input control to have a spinbox interface (e.g., with “up” and “down” arrows). When a number field is not appropriate, use text field instead.
