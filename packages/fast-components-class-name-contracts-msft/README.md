# FAST components class name contracts
This package refrences the BASE class name contracts and provides the TypeScript typings for all MSFT components class name contracts. These contracts enable strict typing of JSS stylesheets and each component's expectation of which class names will be made available (and under which keys those class names reside) to the component at runtime.
