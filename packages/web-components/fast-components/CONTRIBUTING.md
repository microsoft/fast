## The component explorer

The component explorer is a [site](https://explore.fast.design) that showcases the components in the `@microsoft/fast-components` package. This acts as part of the documentation story, in order to expose a component it must have a [definition](#definition) and [configuration](#configuration).

## Definition

Each component must have a [definition](https://github.com/microsoft/fast-dna/tree/master/sites/site-utilities/src/definitions/fast-components/README.md). This file describes the components API.

## Configuration

Each component must have a [configuration](https://github.com/microsoft/fast-dna/tree/master/sites/fast-component-explorer/app/fast-components/configs/README.md). This file contains example data for that component.
