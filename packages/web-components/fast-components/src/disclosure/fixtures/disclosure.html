        Created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Harry Lampert, the original Flash first
        appeared in Flash Comics #1 (cover date January 1940/release month November 1939).
        Nicknamed the "Scarlet Speedster", all incarnations of the Flash possess "super
        speed", which includes the ability to run, move, and think extremely fast, use
        superhuman reflexes, and seemingly violate certain laws of physics.

        Sara Lance, also known by her alter-ego White Canary, is a fictional character in
        The CW's Arrowverse franchise, first introduced in the 2012 pilot episode of the
        television series Arrow, and later starring in Legends of Tomorrow. The character
        is an original character to the television series, created by Greg Berlanti, Marc
        Guggenheim and Andrew Kreisberg, but incorporates character and plot elements of
        the DC Comics character Black Canary. Sara Lance was originally portrayed by
        Jacqueline MacInnes Wood in the pilot episode, and has since been continually
        portrayed by Caity Lotz. Sara initially goes by the moniker of The Canary, a
        translation of her Arabic League of Assassins name ÿßŸÑÿ∑ÿßÿ¶ÿ± ÿßŸÑÿµÿßŸÅÿ± (Ta-er
        al-Sahfer), which translates to "Whistling Bird". She later adopts the code name
        of White Canary before joining the Legends of Tomorrow.
