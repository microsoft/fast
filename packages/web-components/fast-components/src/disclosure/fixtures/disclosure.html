            Created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Harry Lampert, the original Flash
            first appeared in Flash Comics #1 (cover date January 1940/release month
            November 1939). Nicknamed the "Scarlet Speedster", all incarnations of the

            think extremely fast, use superhuman reflexes, and seemingly violate certain
            laws of physics.

        <div>
            Sara Lance, also known by her alter-ego White Canary, is a fictional character
            in The CW's Arrowverse franchise, first introduced in the 2012 pilot episode
            of the television series Arrow, and later starring in Legends of Tomorrow. The
            character is an original character to the television series, created by Greg
            Berlanti, Marc Guggenheim and Andrew Kreisberg, but incorporates character and
            plot elements of the DC Comics character Black Canary. Sara Lance was
            originally portrayed by Jacqueline MacInnes Wood in the pilot episode, and has
            since been continually portrayed by Caity Lotz. Sara initially goes by the
            moniker of The Canary, a translation of her Arabic League of Assassins name
            الطائر الصافر (Ta-er al-Sahfer), which translates to "Whistling Bird". She
            later adopts the code name of White Canary before joining the Legends of
            Tomorrow.
