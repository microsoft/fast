                Created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Harry Lampert, the original Flash
                first appeared in Flash Comics #1 (cover date January 1940/release month
                November 1939). Nicknamed the "Scarlet Speedster", all incarnations of the
                Flash possess "super speed", which includes the ability to run, move, and
                think extremely fast, use superhuman reflexes, and seemingly violate
                certain laws of physics.

                Sara Lance, also known by her alter-ego White Canary, is a fictional
                character in The CW's Arrowverse franchise, first introduced in the 2012
                pilot episode of the television series Arrow, and later starring in
                Legends of Tomorrow. The character is an original character to the
                television series, created by Greg Berlanti, Marc Guggenheim and Andrew
                Kreisberg, but incorporates character and plot elements of the DC Comics
                character Black Canary. Sara Lance was originally portrayed by Jacqueline
                MacInnes Wood in the pilot episode, and has since been continually
                portrayed by Caity Lotz. Sara initially goes by the moniker of The Canary,
                a translation of her Arabic League of Assassins name الطائر الصافر (Ta-er
                al-Sahfer), which translates to "Whistling Bird". She later adopts the
                code name of White Canary before joining the Legends of Tomorrow.
