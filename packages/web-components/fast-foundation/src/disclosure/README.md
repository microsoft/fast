A disclosure component is the implementation of native `details` and `summary` controls that toggles the visibility of the extra content. Visually, it would look like a button or hyperlink and beneath extra content. As defined by the W3C:

> A disclosure is a button that controls the visibility of a section of content. When the controlled content is hidden, it is often styled as a typical push button with a right-pointing arrow or triangle to hint that activating the button will display additional content. When the content is visible, the arrow or triangle typically points down.

## Setup

```ts
import {
    provideFASTDesignSystem,
    fastDisclosure
} from "@microsoft/fast-components";

provideFASTDesignSystem()
    .register(
        fastDisclosure()
    );
```

## Usage

```html live
<fast-disclosure appearance="lightweight">
    <span slot="start">üë©üèª‚Äçü¶≥</span>
    <strong slot="title">Read about White Canary</strong>
    <div>
        Sara Lance, also known by her alter-ego White Canary, is a fictional character
        in The CW's Arrowverse franchise, first introduced in the 2012 pilot episode
