An *anchored region* is a container component which enables authors to create layouts where the contents of the anchored region can be positioned relative to another "anchor" element.  Additionally, the *anchored region* can react to the available space between the anchor and a parent ["viewport"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/viewport) element such that the region is placed on the side of the anchor with the most available space, or even resize itself based on that space.

## Setup

```ts
import {
    provideFASTDesignSystem,
    fastAnchoredRegion
} from "@microsoft/fast-components";

provideFASTDesignSystem()
    .register(
        fastAnchoredRegion()
    );
```

## Usage

A region that always renders above the anchor element.

```html live
<div id="viewport">
    <button id="anchor">
        Button is an anchor
    </button>
    <fast-anchored-region
        anchor="anchor"
        vertical-positioning-mode="locktodefault"
        vertical-default-position="top">
      This shows up above the button
    </fast-anchored-region>
</div>
```

## Create your own design

```ts
import {
    AnchoredRegion,
    anchoredRegionTemplate as template,
} from "@microsoft/fast-foundation";
import { anchoredRegionStyles as styles } from "./my-anchored-region.styles";

export const myAnchoredRegion = AnchoredRegion.compose({
    baseName: "anchored-region",
    template,
    styles,
});
```
