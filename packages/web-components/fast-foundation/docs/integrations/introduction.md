FAST libraries can be used on their own to build modern web sites and applications, but they are also designed to be used in combination with a wide variety of existing technologies. The integrations section of our documentation is dedicated to helping you get FAST Element working with your existing or preferred stack.

:::note
Not seeing an integration for your preferred technology? We'd be happy to work with you to add it. Feel free to kick off a discussion by [opening an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/fast/issues).
