# FAST HTML

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

The `@microsoft/fast-html` package contains a pre-hydration script for HTML rendered in a non-browser environment.

## Requirements

- [NodeJS ^16.0.0](https://nodejs.org)
- [`@microsoft/fast-element@^2.0.0`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/fast-element)

## Design Philosophy

The primary focus of this package is facilitating the creation of templates in HTML that can bind to `FASTElement`. Two approaches are available, creation of templates using the `html` tagged template which can be included in the JavaScript bundle when making the `define()` call from a `FASTElement`, as well as creation of declarative HTML.

The declarative HTML approach does not assume server technology or build time environments and will provide scripts that perform any necessary JavaScript to pre-hydrate the page before JavaScript containing `@microsoft/fast-element` and the definitions of the necessary FAST-based custom elements is loaded. This approach should focus on flexibility for webapp/website developers and gives them scripts and tools to create rendered HTML. This package will supply a Rust script and template syntax for declarative HTML.

Details on usage can be found on the [FAST documentation site](https://fast.design/docs/getting-started/html-templates).

## Declarative HTML

### Usage

In your JS bundle you will need to include the `@microsoft/fast-html` package:

```typescript
import { TemplateElement } from "@microsoft/fast-html";

TemplateElement.define({
    name: "f-template",
});
```

This will include the `<f-template>` custom element and all logic for interpreting the declarative HTML template into a `ViewTemplate`.

### Initial Rendering

An example of the initial rendering generated by your server for declarative HTML might look like this:
```html
<my-custom-element greeting="Hello world">
    <template shadowrootmode="open">
        <!--fe-b$$start$$0$$QYOGJbAbyI$$fe-b-->Hello world<!--fe-b$$end$$0$$QYOGJbAbyI$$fe-b-->
    </template>
</my-custom-element>
<f-template name="my-custom-element">
    <template>{{greeting}}</template>
</f-template>
```

### Writing Components

When writing components with the intention of using the declarative HTML syntax, it is imperative that components are written with styling and rendering of the component to be less reliant on any JavaScript state management. An example of this is relying on `elementInterals` state to style a component.
