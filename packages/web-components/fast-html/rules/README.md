# Tag template to declarative HTML

This folder contains `.yml` rules for the conversion of typical use cases of the `@microsoft/fast-element` tag template literal to the declarative HTML syntax using [ast-grep](https://ast-grep.github.io/).

All rules should be run, the exported template can then be taken and saved as an `.html` file.
