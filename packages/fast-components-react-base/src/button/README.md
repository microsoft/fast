# Button	
*Buttons* are commonly used for final actions that complete a user work flow and the text should communicate what will happen after interaction. Typical use cases include submitting a form, closing a *doalog*, or saving settings. The *button* component can be either an [anchor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) or [button](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) element.
