## Resolver interface

Internally, the DI system maps "keys" to "resolvers". A resolver controls how a dependency is resolved. Resolvers for transient, singleton, etc. are provided out of the box, but you can also implement Resolver yourself and supply custom logic for resolution.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export interface Resolver<K = any> extends ResolverLike<Container, K> 
```
**Extends:** ResolverLike&lt;[Container](../fast-element.container/)<!-- -->, K&gt;
