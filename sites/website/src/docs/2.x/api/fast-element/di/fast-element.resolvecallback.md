## ResolveCallback type

Represents a custom callback for resolving a request from the container. The handler is the container that is invoking the callback. The requestor is the original container that made the request. The handler and the requestor may not be the same if the request has bubbled up to a parent container in the DI hierarchy. The resolver is the instance of the resolver that stores the callback. This is provided in case the callback needs a place or key against which to store state across resolutions.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type ResolveCallback<T = any> = (handler: Container, requestor: Container, resolver: Resolver<T>) => T;
```
