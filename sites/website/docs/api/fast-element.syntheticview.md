## SyntheticView interface

A view representing a range of DOM nodes which can be added/removed adhoc.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface SyntheticView extends View 
```

## Properties

|  Property | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [firstChild](./fast-element.syntheticview.firstchild.md) | Node | The first DOM node in the range of nodes that make up the view. |
|  [lastChild](./fast-element.syntheticview.lastchild.md) | Node | The last DOM node in the range of nodes that make up the view. |

## Methods

|  Method | Description |

|  [dispose()](./fast-element.syntheticview.dispose.md) | Removes the view and unbinds its behaviors, disposing of DOM nodes afterward. Once a view has been disposed, it cannot be inserted or bound again. |
|  [insertBefore(node)](./fast-element.syntheticview.insertbefore.md) | Inserts the view's DOM nodes before the referenced node. |
|  [remove()](./fast-element.syntheticview.remove.md) | Removes the view's DOM nodes. The nodes are not disposed and the view can later be re-inserted. |
